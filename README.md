#Starter

Here is some sample code showing you how to get started with: chrome extension scripts, chrome storage and DOM manipulation with content scrips.

The brain of this app is the manifest.json.

The inject script has control of the DOM on visited web pages.

The background script has control of the browser.

In order to have a pop up window in the corner of the screen you will need to create a popup.html file and add this to the manifest.
